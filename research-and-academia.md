## Research Focus

My research is in gravitational-wave science, with a focus on data analysis, detector characterization, and the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to complex physical systems.

Key topics:

- Gravitational-wave data analysis
- Noise characterization and mitigation in interferometric detectors
- System identification and data conditioning
- Transient signal detection
- Machine learning and AI for physics applications
- Cross-disciplinary work connecting physics, data science, and geophysics

I am a member of the **LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration**.
