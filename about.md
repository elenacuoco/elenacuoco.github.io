I am a physicist and data scientist with more than twenty years of experience in data analysis for the Virgo gravitational-wave experiment. From March 2018 to September 2024, I served as Head of the Data Science Office at the European Gravitational Observatory, and from March 2018 to January 2024 I was Associate Faculty at the Scuola Normale Superiore.

I hold a degree in Physics, with a specialization in statistical analysis applied to astrophysics and a focus on the large-scale structure of the Universe. I began my research career during my Ph.D. fellowship in the Physics Department at the University of Pisa, where I started working on the Virgo experiment.

My expertise lies in noise analysis, system identification, and data conditioning for complex detectors. I have developed algorithms for signal detection and data characterization, including the application of machine learning techniques to transient signal analysis. Between 2008 and 2014, I led the Virgo noise analysis group, and from 2014 to 2018 I served as Scientific Coordinator of the GraWIToN Initial Training Network, an international program dedicated to educating early-career researchers in gravitational-wave science.

Within the LIGO–Virgo collaboration, I have co-chaired the Machine Learning informal group and actively promoted the integration of artificial intelligence into gravitational-wave data analysis. I am a Kaggle Master and was the main proposer and Action Chair of the COST Action CA17137, *“A Network for Gravitational Waves, Geophysics, and Machine Learning.”*

Since 2024, I have been a Full Professor at the University of Bologna. My current research focuses on gravitational-wave data analysis, detector characterization, and the development of artificial intelligence methods for the detection of astrophysical signals. I am a member of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration, author of numerous scientific publications, and actively involved in European and international research initiatives.
