I served as Head of the Data Science Office at the European Gravitational Observatory and from March 2018 to January 2024  held a position as Associate Faculty at Scuola Normale Superiore. With over 20 years of experience in data analysis for the Virgo experiment, I hold a degree in Physics, specializing in Statistical Analysis in Astrophysics with a focus on the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe. I earned a Ph.D. fellowship in the Physics Department at Pisa, where I began my work on Virgo.

As an expert in noise analysis and system identification, I have developed algorithms for data conditioning and signal detection. From 2008 to 2014, I led the noise analysis group for Virgo, where I created algorithms for data characterization and transient signal analysis, incorporating machine learning techniques in this field. From 2014 to 2018, I was the Scientific Coordinator of the GraWIToN Initial Training Network, dedicated to training young scientists in gravitational wave research. Additionally, I co-chaired the Machine Learning informal group within the LIGO/Virgo collaboration and earned the Kaggle Master rank. I was also the main proposer and Action Chair for COST Action CA17137, “A Network for Gravitational Waves, Geophysics, and Machine Learning.”

Since 2024, I have been a Full Professor at the University of Bologna, focusing on research in gravitational wave science. As a member of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration, my work centers on data analysis and the application of artificial intelligence techniques for detector characterization and the detection of astrophysical gravitational wave signals. I am the author of numerous scientific publications and actively participate in various European and international initiatives.
